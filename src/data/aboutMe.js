      <p>Hello, my name is Blaz Pocrnja!<p>
      <p>I am a Computer Science student at the University of Alberta.
      I currently work in the Department of Civil Engineering where I help
      design and create software for graduate students' research as well as
      commercial construction companies.<p>

      <p>In my free time I enjoy exercise through Kickboxing,
      Brazilian jiu-jitsu, and weightlifting. I socialize often with friends
      through DnD, or by having regular movie and dinner nights. The rest of
      my time is dedicated to learning new skills and hobbies!</p>

      <p>I can be found on
      <a href="https://github.com/BlazPocrnja" target="_blank">Github</a> and
      <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/blaz-pocrnja/" target=_blank>LinkedIn</a>.
