  description: `
      <p>My career as a software developer started in 2013, where I decided to major in the computer sciences.
      I always had an interest in problem solving and finding out how things worked, and with my love of technology
      (namely video games) the decision to pursue CS became a no-brainer. In 2017, I interned at the University of Alberta's
      Hole School of Construction where I learned to work with others in a more professional capacity. I graduated in the spring of 2019,
      with a BSc in Computer Science with a Specialization in Software Practice. I currently work at EllisDon's PME office, 
      writing software for quality management.
      <p>

      <p>I enjoy working in a collaborative team environment, where I can both learn and grow from others,
      as well as give back any of my own knowledge and experience that may be of use.</p>
