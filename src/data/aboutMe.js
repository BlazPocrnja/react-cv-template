      <p>Hello, my name is Blaz Pocrnja!<p>
      <p>I am a recent graduate from the University of Alberta. 
      I have 6 years of computing science studies under my belt, with an additional
      2 years of professional experience working with The Hole School of Construction Engineering, 
      where I helped create software for commercial, educational, and research purposes.<p>

      <p>My approach to programming has always been about creating extensible and maintainable code
      with a focus on high level abstraction in the form of object-oriented programming.
      While I am able to work and learn independently, I strongly prefer to work
      in a collaborative team environment, where I can both learn and grow from others, as well as give back
      any of my own knowledge and experience that may be of use.</p>

      <p>I can be found on
      <a href="https://github.com/BlazPocrnja" target="_blank">Github</a> and
      <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/blaz-pocrnja/" target=_blank>LinkedIn</a>.
